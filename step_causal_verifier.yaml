      This step is not acceptable: causal logic is not rigorous.
      Please rewrite ONLY this step and try again. Requirements:
      - Make the reasoning causally coherent with the prior context
      - skip unecessaryh steps
      - Do not add multiple steps at once (only generate 1-3 sentences)
    pns_ok_continue_msg: |-
      Good. Continue with the next step (one step only).
    pns_ok_finish_msg: |-
      Good. Now provide the complete final solution and end with <ANSWER>...</ANSWER>.
    pns_proceed_after_penalty_msg: |-
      Too many retries. Proceed to the next step anyway (one step only).
